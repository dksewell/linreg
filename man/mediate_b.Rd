\usage{
mediate_b(
  model_m,
  model_y,
  treat,
  control_value,
  treat_value,
  n_draws = 500,
  ask_before_full_sampling = TRUE,
  CI_level = 0.95,
  seed = 1,
  mc_error = ifelse("glm_b" \%in\% model_y, 0.01, 0.002),
  batch_size = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_m}{a fitted model object of class lm_b for mediator.}

\item{model_y}{a fitted model object of class lm_b for outcome.}

\item{treat}{a character string indicating the name of the
treatment variable used in the models.  NOTE: Treatment variable must be
numeric (even if it's 1's and 0's).}

\item{control_value}{value of the treatment variable used as the
control condition. Default is the 1st quintile of the treat variable.}

\item{treat_value}{value of the treatment variable used as the treatment condition.
Default is the 4th quintile of the treat variable.}

\item{n_draws}{Number of preliminary posterior draws to assess final
number of posterior draws required for accurate interval estimation}

\item{ask_before_full_sampling}{logical.  If FALSE, the user will not
be asked if they want to complete the full sampling.  Defaults to
TRUE, as this can be a computationally intensive procedure.}

\item{CI_level}{numeric. Credible interval level.}

\item{mc_error}{positive scalar.  The number of posterior samples will,
with high probability, estimate the CI bounds up to
\eqn{\pm}\code{mc_error}\eqn{\times}\code{sd(y)}.}

\item{batch_size}{positive integer.  Number of posterior draws to be
taken at once.  Higher values are more computationally intensive, but
values which are too high might take up significant memory (allocates
on the order of \code{batch_size}\eqn{\times}\code{nrow(model_y$data)}).}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{summary} - tibble giving results for causal mediation quantities
\item \code{posterior_draws} (of counterfactual expectations)
\item \code{mc_error} absolute error used, including any rescaling
to match the scale of the outcome
\item other inputs to \code{mediate_b}
}

\description{
Mediation analysis done in the framework of Imai et al. (2010).  Currently
only applicable to linear models.
}
\details{
The model is the same as that of Imai et al. (2010):
\deqn{
 M_i(X) =  w_i'\alpha_m + X\beta_m + \epsilon_{m,i}, \\
 y_i(X, M(\tilde X)) = w_i'\alpha_y + X\beta_y + M(\tilde X)\gamma + \epsilon_{y,i}, \\
 \epsilon_{m,i} \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2_m), \\
 \epsilon_{y,i} \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2_y), \\
}
where \eqn{M_i(X)} is the mediator as a function of the treatment variable
\eqn{X}, and \eqn{w_i} are confounder covariates.

Unlike the \code{mediation} R package, the estimation in \code{mediate_b}
is fully Bayesian (as opposed to "quasi-Bayesian").
