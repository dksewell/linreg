\title{Bayes factors for lm_b, glm_b, and survfit_b}
\usage{
bayes_factors(object, ...)

\method{bayes_factors}{lm_b}(object, by = "coefficient", ...)

\method{bayes_factors}{glm_b}(object, by = "coefficient", ...)

\method{bayes_factors}{survfit_b}(object, object2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{lm_b or glm_b object}

\item{by}{character.  Either "coefficient" or "variable".  If the former,
Bayes factors will be computed for each regression coefficient separately.
If the latter, Bayes factors will be computed for each covariate separately.}
}
\description{
Bayes factors for Bayesian regression objects using the Savage-Dickey ratio
}
\details{
Bayes factors are given in terms of favoring the two-tailed alternative hypothesis
vs. the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient equals zero.
Currently implemented for \code{lm_b} or \code{glm_b} objects.  Note
that for \code{glm_b} objects, if importance sampling was used,
the model will be refit using fixed form variational Bayes to get
the multivariate posterior density.

Interpretation is taken from Kass and Raftery.
