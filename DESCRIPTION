Description: Perform fundamental analyses using Bayesian inference (regression, anova, 1 and 2 sample inference, non-parametric tests, etc.).  (Practically) no MCMC is used; all exact finite sample inference is completed via closed form solutions or else through posterior sampling automated to ensure precision in interval estimate bounds.
