#' Find parameters for Beta prior based on prior mean and one quantile
#' 
#' @param mean numeric between 0 and 1 giving the prior mean
#' @param quantile numeric between 0 and 1 giving the quantile lying at left_tail_prob
#' @param left_tail_prob numeric between 0 and 1 giving the prior probability of theta 
#' being less than or equal to quantile
#' @param search_bounds bounds with which to search.  Sometimes you need to adjust this to get a good solution.

#' @examples
#' find_beta_parms(2/5,0.68,0.9)
#' 2/ (2 + 3)
#' qbeta(0.9,2,3)
